About BroadNet PTT
Built for users by users we have tried to address all the shortcomings that we have found in other software. Offering private channels, text messaging and many other features, BroadNet PTT is just like having a real radio in your pocket with none of the bulk! 

Paired with our own BN-01 Handsets which you can purchase at (www.broadnet.systems) we believe that we have the perfect solution for long distance communications. Unlike traditional two way radios, BroadNet PTT works over the existing data network, enabling communication around the world!! 

At BroadNet, we do not just offer an app, but a complete managed communications system. Offering simplicity and dependability.

Emergency channels - Use our fully managed (by volunteers) emg channels if you are a lone worker requiring support etc. Report incidents and welfare checks etc. See Broadnet Emergency Network group on facebook for more details. These are inter organization channels. They are UKEMG1 UKEMG2 and UKEMGDISP. Enable in options.

Scan mode, hold the CHA button to start. You can add channels by clicking CHA and holding down a channel to add it to the list. Hold again to remove. The EMG channels can be added in Options and UKEMGDISP can be scanned using the tick box.
